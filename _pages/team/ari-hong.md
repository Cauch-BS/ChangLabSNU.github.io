I currently study biochemistry and computational biology to develope direct RNA sequencing methodologies, especailly for decoding new insights into translation and epitranscriptomics. 

#### Education

<ul class="chronological">
  <li><span>2020–present</span> Master's Student, Interdisciplinary Program in Bioinformatics, Seoul National University</li>
  <li><span>2016–2020</span> Bachelor of Agriculture in Food Science and Biotechnology, Seoul National University</li>
</ul>


#### Research Experience

<ul class="chronological">
  <li><span>2020–present</span> Master's Student, Interdisciplinary Program in Bioinformatics, Seoul National University</li> I’m studying computational biology, especially about Direct RNA sequencing or DRS, transcriptomics, and epigenetics. Under the tutelage of Dr. Hyeshik Chang, I'm developing new methodologies for DRS to decoding new insights into epigenome. Also I’m working on high throughput analysis for the mechanisms of translation.
  <li><span>2019–2020</span> Intern, Seoul National University</li> As a undergraduate at the Seoul National University, I had internship in Dr.Chang's lab. I learned the basic methods to analyze high-throughput RNA sequencing data, including ribosome profiling, or CLIPseq using datas from 'LIN28A Is a Suppressor of ER-Associated Translation in Embryonic Stem Cells' (Cho et al, 2012) for 2 months. In September 2019, I started a project to proceed with the master's course and develop an analysis pipeline. I also learned experimental techniques such as cell culture, RNA extraction, in vitro transcription, and gel extraction.
  <li><span>2019–2019</span> Intern, Seoul National University</li> I worked as undergraduate research student at Food Engineering Laboratory for 2 months. Under Dr. Youngjin Choi, I constructed system to detect target from food sample, such as allergen or food poisoning bacteria. Gold nanoparticle, silica nanoparticle, and aptamer were used to that system, and I optimized the their ratio to present shift of precipitation area according to target concentration.
<li><span>2017-2019</span> Undergraduate Research Assistant, Center for food and bioconvergence Seoul National University</li> I worked as undergraduate research assistant at CFB or center for food and bio convergence located in Seoul National University. Under Dr.Yang Kim, I worked on preparing a sample for the paper(Yang et al, 2020).
